# Project 3: 3-Tier Infrastructure Deployment Using Terraform Modules

## 🧑 Author
**Anjali Dale**

## 📌 Objective
Design and deploy a complete **3-tier web application architecture on AWS** using **Terraform modules**. The infrastructure is modular, scalable, and built using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **VPC Tier (Networking Layer)**:
  - Custom VPC with public & private subnets across 2 Availability Zones
  - Internet Gateway for public subnets
  - NAT Gateway for private subnets
  - Route Tables, Security Groups, and NACLs

- **Web Tier (Public Subnet)**:
  - EC2 instance with Nginx and HTML registration form (via User Data or Ansible)

- **App Tier (Private Subnet)**:
  - EC2 instance running `submit.php` to receive and store form data
  - Connects to RDS securely using a provisioner script or Ansible

- **Database Tier (Private Subnet)**:
  - Amazon RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL) instance
  - Configured with security groups and private subnet group

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Terraform v1.x
- AWS EC2, RDS, VPC, NAT Gateway, IGW
- Ansible or Terraform provisioners
- Git & GitHub

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Awaish05/Tier-Infrastructure-Deployment-Using-Terraform-Modules.git
cd Tier-Infrastructure-Deployment-Using-Terraform-Modules

Step 2: Initialize Terraform

terraform init

Step 3: Plan the Infrastructure

terraform plan

Step 4: Apply to Deploy

terraform apply

Step 5: Destroy Resources (Optional)

terraform destroy

🔐 Security Considerations

    RDS security group allows access only from App Tier EC2 instance

    App Tier EC2 is in a private subnet (no public IP)

    Web Tier EC2 uses Security Groups to allow HTTP/SSH traffic

    Minimal IAM permissions assigned to resources

🖼️ Screenshots (Place in /screenshots folder)

    ✅ Terraform Plan and Apply success

    ✅ AWS Console: VPC, EC2, RDS

    ✅ Nginx form loaded in browser

    ✅ Data inserted into RDS

    ✅ submit.php running properly in app-tier EC2

📦 Deliverables

    ✅ Modular Terraform Code

    ✅ Architecture Diagram

    ✅ Screenshots of working setup

    ✅ This README.md file

📘 How It Works

    Web Tier EC2 runs Nginx with a form

    Submits data to submit.php hosted on App Tier EC2 (private)

    App Tier EC2 inserts form data into RDS MySQL/PostgreSQL

    All communication happens within the secure VPC
